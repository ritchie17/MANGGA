# MANGGA

The MANGGA Project is an initiative undertaken that aims to automate the traditionally labor-intensive manual sorting process of carabao mangoes conducted at local farms. The project was able to secure funding from the Department of Science and Technology - Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development (DOST-PCAARRD). The projectâ€™s primary objective is to tackle problems introduced by the manual mango classification process, which is often time-consuming and subjective. With a duration of two years, the project has already achieved significant progress in achieving its expected outputs within the first year. One key achievement of the project is the successful development of a data acquisition system. The developed system was utilized in acquiring data for the establishment of a comprehensive dataset. We have also already identified six (6) strategic sites for our data gathering, four (4) of which we have already collected samples and gathered data from. The team is continually identifying more sites as of this date. A systematic and standardized approach to data acquisition has also already been established. The data acquisition efforts have already yielded substantial results. To date, we have already acquired a dataset consisting of 16,164 images from 1,347 individual mangoes captured at differing orientations and angles, providing a diverse and robust foundation for training our AI model. The team shall continue acquiring data to ensure a reliable, trained AI model. A single-input CNN model has been developed that can be used for mango classification and maturity classification.
